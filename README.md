What is Pokémon Manager?
-
Pokémon Manager is alternative to Pokémon Bank and Pokémon Home for computers.

IMPORTANT:
-
Pokémon Manager is not a save editor, it is only able to read PK files. Also, due to my lack of experience of doing projects like Pokémon Manager, I will make a lot of mistakes in terms of optimization and organization. Please feel free to make constructive feedback and help me understand my mistakes. Side note to Nintendo, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, this program in no way is trying to compete with Pokémon Bank and Pokémon Home, this is just an alternative to people who are willing to homebrew their consoles to store their Pokémon on their computer and in no way condones cheating in any form.

Setup:
-

- Pre-requisites:
  - Have downloaded the latest version of [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX), opened a save file, and dumped Pokémon into the database.
  - Pokémon Manager uses [PokéAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi) to make the code cleaner and save space, but since it's on the internet, you require wifi or ethernet when adding new Pokémon.
- Installing:
  - Download the latest version of Pokémon Manager.
  - Extract the zip file into the same folder as PKHeX.
  - Open Pokémon Manager and enjoy!
  
Features:
- 
 - [x] Displays Pokémon's PokéDex entry.
 - [x] Shows known moves with pp, power, type, and damage class.
 - [x] Stats chart with base stats and ivs.
 - [x] Search for specific Pokémon by nickname, typing, and gender.
 - [x] Rename, and add boxes to your liking (Empty boxes are not stored).
 - [x] Ability to make multiple parties.
 - [x] Compatibility with alternate forms (Currently, there are no PokéDex entries for alternate Pokémon in PokéAPI so alternate forms will show the first form's entry and not the correct form's entry. This will be fixed in a future update)
 - [x] Make a personalized profile.
 - [x] Copy parties and boxes to your clipboard and paste them into Pokémon Showdown.

In progress/Planned:
-
   - [ ] Stats chart with ivs, evs, and base stats.
   - [ ] pk8, pk4, pk3, pk2, pk1 files will be supported soon.
   - [ ] Transfer Pokémon with someone else online.
   - [ ] Switch from requiring internet to having PokeAPI's database integrated with Pokémon Manager.
   - [ ] Show trainer info (meaning the trainer's name and details) for each Pokémon and search by trainers.
   - [ ] Switch PokéDex entries when viewing Pokémon.
   - [ ] Switch icons between 3d models, home icons, and sprites.
   - [ ] More organization tools.
