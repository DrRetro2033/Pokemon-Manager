View, organize, and manage your Pokémon.


What is Pokémon Manager?
-
Pokémon Manager is made in the Godot engine and was made to replace the PK Database in PkHEX.

IMPORTANT:
-
Pokémon Manager is not a save editor. Also, due to my lack of experience of doing projects like Pokémon Manager, I will make a lot of mistakes in terms of optimization and organization. Please feel free to make constructive feedback and help me understand my mistakes. 
 
Setup:
-

- Pre-requisites:
  - Have downloaded the latest version of PkHEX, opened a save file, and dumped Pokémon into the database.
  - Pokémon Manager uses PokéAPI to make the code cleaner and save space, but since it's on the internet, you require wifi or ethernet when adding new Pokémon.
- Installing:
  - Download the latest version of Pokémon Manager.
  - Extract the zip file into the same folder as PkHEX.
  - Open Pokémon Manager and enjoy!

 - Search for specific Pokémon by nickname, typing, and gender.

 - In progress/Planned:
   - Stats chart with ivs, evs, and base stats.
