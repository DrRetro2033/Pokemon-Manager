What is Pokémon Manager?

- Pre-requisites:
  - Have downloaded the latest version of PkHEX, opened a save file, and dumped Pokémon into the database.
  - Pokémon Manager uses PokéAPI to make the code cleaner and save space, but since it's on the internet, you require wifi or ethernet when adding new Pokémon.
  
Features:
- 
 - Displays Pokémon's PokéDex entry.
 - Shows known moves with pp, power, type, and form.
 - Stats chart with ivs, evs, and base stats.
 - Drag and drop Pokémon into a blank space or switch positions with another Pokémon.
 - Search for specific Pokémon by nickname, typing, and gender.
 - Rename, and add boxes to your liking (Empty boxes are not stored to save on space)
