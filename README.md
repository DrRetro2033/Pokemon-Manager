What is Pokémon Manager?
-
As the 3ds and Wii U's e-shop draws to a close, all online only services will be lost. One of the most consering is Pokémon Bank, as soon your pokémon from the 3DS games, and consequently DS games, and GBA games will be trapped on your console. Thankfully, the 3ds homebrewing and the Pokémon community has already made software to transfer help transfer Pokémon to the switch. The most important software for this process is PkHéx, as it allows users to copy pokémon from one save file to another. PkHéx is an amazing piece of software, but in my option, the only problem I have with it is the pk database. The pk database is only designed to store copies of pokémon, but I feel that it could be expanded to be a easier way to store pokémon on your computer. So I created Pokémon Manager with the main goal of being a more visual way to manage pokémon and be a alternative to Pokémon Home.

IMPORTANT:
-
Pokémon Manager is not a save editor, it is only able to read PK files. Also, due to my lack of experience of doing projects like Pokémon Manager, I will make a lot of mistakes in terms of optimization and organization. Please feel free to make constructive feedback and help me understand my mistakes. 
 
Setup:
-

- Pre-requisites:
  - Have downloaded the latest version of PkHéx, opened a save file, and dumped Pokémon into the database.
  - Pokémon Manager uses PokéAPI to make the code cleaner and save space, but since it's on the internet, you require wifi or ethernet when adding new Pokémon.
- Installing:
  - Download the latest version of Pokémon Manager.
  - Extract the zip file into the same folder as PkHéx.
  - Open Pokémon Manager and enjoy!
  
Features:
- 
 - Displays Pokémon's PokéDex entry.
 - Shows known moves with pp, power, type, and damage class.
 - Stats chart with base stats and ivs.
 - Drag and drop Pokémon into a blank space or switch positions with another Pokémon.
 - Search for specific Pokémon by nickname, typing, and gender.
 - Rename, and add boxes to your liking (Empty boxes are not stored).
 - By my understanding of the Godot Engine, you could theoretically keep Pokémon Manager, PkHéx, and your pokémon on a usb stick and plug it into a brand new computer and it should work
 
 - In progress/Planned:
   - Stats chart with ivs, evs, and base stats.
   - pk8, pk5, pk4, pk3, pk2, pk1 files will be supported soon.
   - Transfer Pokémon with someone else online.
   - Switch from requiring internet to having PokeAPI's database integrated with Pokémon Manager.
   - Compatibility with alternate forms.

   - Display Pokémon's level and have it effect the stats chart.
   - Switch PokéDex entries when viewing Pokémon.

   - More organization tools and add the ability to make multiple parties.
